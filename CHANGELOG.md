# Changelog

All notable changes to the Harness Project Agent will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Safe directory browsing (`list_directory`) with depth clamping (1-3) and entry caps
- Safe file reading (`read_file`) with line ranges, numbered output, and 400-line call caps
- Repository code search (`search_code`) - pure Python, case-insensitive substring plus optional regex, no shell
- Dependency manifest analysis (`analyze_dependencies`) for pyproject.toml / requirements*.txt / package.json via stdlib tomllib
- Shared repository path-safety module (`path_utils.py`)
- Repository understanding workflow in the system prompt (locate → search → read → answer)
- Manual tool/security smoke script (`scripts/smoke_repo_tools.py`)
- Test coverage increased from 27 to 92 deterministic tests

### Safety

- Repository-root confinement: all resolved paths must stay inside the project root
- Path traversal protection (`../`, absolute paths, drive/UNC paths)
- Sensitive file blocking (.env, .env.*, keys, certificates, credentials) with `.env.example` explicitly allowed
- Ignored directories (.git, .venv, __pycache__, node_modules, dist, build, *.egg-info) excluded from browsing/search/reading
- Binary file blocking by extension and content sniffing (NUL-byte detection)
- Output size limits everywhere with `truncated` flags
- Read-only operations only: no writes, no shell, no network

### Verification

- 92/92 deterministic tests passing
- `python -m compileall src scripts` clean
- Manual tool smoke tests executed (list_directory / read_file / search_code / analyze_dependencies)
- Security smoke tests executed (traversal blocked, .env blocked, .env.example allowed, ignored dirs excluded)
- Live LLM smoke test not executed (no API key configured in this environment)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Correct Strands Agent invocation using `agent(prompt)` instead of non-existent `agent.chat()`
- Correct OpenAIModel initialization using `client_args` dict and `model_id` parameter
- Correct AgentResult handling using `str(result)` for text extraction
- Added explicit `openai>=3.0.0` dependency to pyproject.toml

### Added

- Agent factory tests (7 tests) verifying correct SDK API usage
- CLI tests (8 tests) verifying correct agent invocation
- Total test coverage increased from 12 to 27 tests

### Verification

- 27/27 deterministic tests passing
- SDK integration verified with Strands Agents 1.52.0
- Import verification successful
- CLI smoke test verified (without live API)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Single Agent architecture based on Strands Agents SDK
- Project inspection tool (`inspect_project`) for read-only repository analysis
- Configuration system with environment variable validation
- System prompt defining agent behavior
- Interactive CLI interface
- Deterministic unit tests (12 tests for config and tools)
- MIT License
- Comprehensive README documentation

### Security

- Read-only safety boundary (no file modification or shell execution)
- Sensitive file filtering (excludes .env, credentials, keys, etc.)
- API key validation and secure configuration management
